/**
 * Unpatched bambu-node 3.22.21 parses every MQTT report in an async listener and
 * throws from it for printers or state transitions it does not model: H2S/H2D/
 * H2C/H2D Pro/P2S serial prefixes, a get_version reply without an ota module, and
 * transitions such as PAUSE -> IDLE after a cancel. It also sends a PushAll
 * request on connect and leaves its 5 s timeout unhandled, which rejects when a
 * printer never answers information requests (seen on X1 Carbons on firmware
 * 01.07, which still accept control commands) but still broadcasts reports. Those throws become
 * unhandled promise rejections, which terminate Node by default.
 * bambu-printer-mcp avoids this with a postinstall patch; this package does not
 * install one.
 *
 * Safety checks here never rely on bambu-node's model or job tracking: they read
 * fresh raw MQTT reports. Only these exact internal errors originating inside
 * bambu-node are logged and ignored. Every other unhandled rejection is rethrown,
 * preserving Node's default crash behavior.
